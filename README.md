# 01 - Project [Custom Hooks]

The `useCurrencyCodes` custom hook is designed to provide a list of currency codes for use in applications that require currency-related functionality.
Custom Hooks always help to understand how built-in hooks like `useState`, `useEffects`, and so on work internally. In this project, I have created a custom `useCurrencyCode`
hook to get the data from the API and use it in the project.
This project has some bugs while converting, But the main goal is to demonstrate the custom hooks you can modify the code a little bit so that it can work well.

# 02 - Project [React Routers]

While React is primarily used for building single-page applications (SPAs), you can transform it into a multi-page web application using the React Router library. 
This project serves as a demonstration of how to integrate React Router into your application to enable multiple pages and navigation between them. 
The goal is to show how React Router can be used to create a more traditional, multi-page website structure within a React-based project.
you need the following libraries to work with the react routing

```bash
npm install react-router
```
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```
